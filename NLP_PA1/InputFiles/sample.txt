Phil Gote of NYISO called.  They have an application from ENA to participate in the "Virtual Bidding Markets", which I expect we are not going to do for either EES or EPMI.  Please let me know so they can close out the application.  Thanks.

Good morning all.
Attached is the info that Esther helped me pull together for Rod last Wednesday. Rod told me over the weekend that he needs commodity volumes for these contracts for the years 1997-2000.  Help?  Can someone pull this together quickly for me?
